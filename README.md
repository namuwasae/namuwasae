I earned a **B.S. in Computer Engineering**, focused heavily on **AI** during my studies.  
Now I work as an **AI-driven developer**, building end-to-end systems that connect **product + frontend + backend + models**.

Recently, I'm especially into **generative AI** — using **open-source models** and **model APIs** for **image/video workflows**,  
while also continuing to enjoy building **apps** and **web products**.

## 🧩 What I’m into

- **AI-powered applications** (practical, shippable systems)
- End-to-end system design (**Frontend ↔ Backend ↔ Model**)
- **LLMs, RAG pipelines**, and custom inference workflows
- **Automation / agent-like systems** (n8n, pipelines)
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration using LangGraph and CrewAI**
- **UX/UI design**
- Product thinking & marketing for apps / AI services
